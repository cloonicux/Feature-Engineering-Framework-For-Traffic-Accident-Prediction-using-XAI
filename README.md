# Feature-Engineering-Framework-For-Traffic-Accident-Prediction-using-XAI
This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict the severity of traffic accidents, providing a crucial tool for enhancing road safety. By analyzing the comprehensive STATS19 dataset from 2023, which includes detailed information on collisions, vehicles, and casualties, this project goes beyond simple prediction. It employs  LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) technique to demystify the model's decisions, offering clear and understandable explanations for why a particular accident is classified as 'Fatal,' 'Serious,' or 'Slight.'

The journey begins with meticulous data preparation, where raw government data is transformed into a clean, unified, and analysis-ready dataset. This involves decoding categorical variables, merging disparate data sources, and intelligently handling missing values. The project's innovative feature engineering then comes into play, creating insightful new variables such as a composite 'environmental hazard' score, a 'driver risk profile' based on age, and a 'time risk' category that captures the nuances of accident timing.

Through in-depth exploratory data analysis, the project uncovers critical patterns and relationships, revealing, for example, the times of day and days of the week with the highest accident frequencies and the impact of environmental conditions on accident severity. These insights not only inform the predictive model but also provide a valuable resource for understanding the multifaceted nature of road accidents.

Ultimately, this project delivers a practical and interpretable solution for traffic accident severity prediction. By not only forecasting the severity of accidents but also explaining the 'why' behind its predictions, it offers a powerful tool for policymakers, law enforcement, and transportation authorities to develop targeted interventions and make our roads safer for everyone. The Application and use of LIME in this project also shows that LIME can be used as a diagnostic tool for Models.
